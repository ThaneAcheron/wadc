correct way to embed license info in JAR?
replace pnames list with a hash or something (remove duplicates?)
default window size better

would be nice if current seed was printed when executing. however,
we can't get the rng seed, so we'll have to set it ourselves.

it would be cool to embed the source in the WAD!
