= Release Notes

== What's broken since 1.3?

=== Required Java version

WadC now requires Java version 1.8 or newer to run or build. It has been
tested only with

* java version "1.8.0\_45"
* javac 1.8.0\_45

=== wadc.cfg location

wadc.cfg is no longer written/read from the current working directory. On
Windows, it's found at `%USERHOME%/.wadc/wadc.cfg`, on UNIX platforms it
looks in `$HOME/.wadc`. Examples

```
    c:\Users\Your Name\.wadc
    /Users/Jon/.wadc
    /home/you/.wadc
```

=== changed preferences

`doomcmd` no longer exists. It has been replaced with

 * `doomexe`  - path to your preferred doom executable
 * `doomargs` - arguments to pass to your preferred doom executable,
                separated by whitespace. This should end with '`-file`'.

The reason for this is to allow you to supply a `doomexe` containing
whitespace in the path.

=== texture/resource wads

If you have defined any of `twad1`, `twad2` or `twad3` in your
configuration, they will be added to the doom command line, immediately
after your `doomargs`, and before the path to the WAD you are building.
