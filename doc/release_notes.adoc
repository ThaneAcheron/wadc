== (will be) 2.0 (currently RC)

=== What's new

==== Core program changes

===== Distribution and runtime requirements

The WadC binary distribution is now a JAR file. On most platforms,
simply double-clicking on the JAR should launch the program. WadC
is no longer sensitive to the directory from which it is launched.

WadC now requires Java version 1.8 or newer to run or build. It has been
tested only with

* java version "1.8.0\_45"
* javac 1.8.0\_45

===== configuration file syntax and location

wadc.cfg is no longer written/read from the current working directory. On
Windows, it's found at `%USERHOME%/.wadc/wadc.cfg`, on UNIX platforms it
looks in `$HOME/.wadc`. Examples

```
    c:\Users\Your Name\.wadc
    /Users/Jon/.wadc
    /home/you/.wadc
```

The configuration option `doomcmd` no longer exists. It has been replaced
with

 * `doomexe`  - path to your preferred doom executable
 * `doomargs` - arguments to pass to your preferred doom executable,
                separated by whitespace. This should end with '`-file`'.

The reason for this is to allow you to supply a `doomexe` containing
whitespace in the path.

If you have defined any of `twad1`, `twad2` or `twad3` in your
configuration, they will be added to the doom command line, immediately
after your `doomargs`, and before the path to the WAD you are building.

===== Embedded WadC code

WadC now writes out the source code for your level to the generated WAD
in a `WADCSRC` lump.

If you define any new textures, WadC will write a `TEXTURE2` lump.  If you add
any patches to new textures which are not in your IWAD, A new `PNAMES` lump
will be generated and written. You need to have specified a path to an IWAD
file in your configuration for this to work.

==== Language features

 * `die(foo)`: prints foo, then terminates.
 * `cat(a, b)`: concatenates a and b
 * `seed(x)`: seeds the random-number generator for reproducibility
 * `newtag`: generate and return a new unique tag number
 * `texture`: begins the definition of a new texture, to combine with
   - `addpatch`: which adds a patch to the currently defined texture

===== Library additions

 * `lisp.h`, lisp-style lists (broken out from `examples/lisp.wl`)
 * `water.h`, Boom deep water tools
 * within `standard.h`:
   - `inc` and `dec`, convenient for increment/decrementing a variable
   - `fori` and `i`, the `for` loop but you can read the value of the iterator

===== New examples

 - `textures.wl`, demonstrating the texture features
 - `llevels.wl`, test WAD using texture features
 - `water.wl`, demonstrating the Boom water helpers
 - "beta" directory containing my unfinished stuff

==== Bug fixes

Fix map view zooming with mouse clicks on non-Windows platforms.

The paths to the file you are editing, the corresponding generated WAD file,
your preferred Doom executable and any texture WADs you have defined can now
contain spaces or other special characters.
